AIM: Introduction to Raspberry Pi Model B and Its Components
1.  What is Raspberry Pi?
Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable, credit card-sized computer developed by the Raspberry Pi
 Foundation (UK).

It was created to promote teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries.

Despite its size, it is a fully functional Linux-based computer capable of:

Running operating systems (like Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu),

Programming (Python, C, Java),

Interfacing with hardware (sensors, motors, cameras),

Acting as an IoT device, server, or media center.

2.  What is Raspberry Pi Model B?
Model B refers to one of the main variants of Raspberry Pi.

It typically represents a higher-spec version compared to Model A (more RAM, more USB ports,
 Ethernet, etc.).

Several generations exist:

Raspberry Pi 1 Model B (2012),

Raspberry Pi 2 Model B (2015),

Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (2016),

Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2019).

For this theory, we will refer generally to Model B characteristics, especially popular 
ones like Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and 4 Model B.

3. Key Components of Raspberry Pi Model B
Let’s break down each major component:

3.1 Broadcom SoC (System on Chip)
Combines the CPU, GPU, and RAM on a single chip.

Example:

Pi 3 Model B uses Broadcom BCM2837 (64-bit Quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz).

Pi 4 Model B uses Broadcom BCM2711 (Quad-core Cortex-A72 @ 1.5GHz).

Handles processing tasks just like a normal PC.

3.2 RAM (Memory)
Temporary memory used to store running programs and OS processes.

RAM sizes:

Pi 3 Model B: 1 GB LPDDR2 RAM.

Pi 4 Model B: Available in 2GB, 4GB, 8GB LPDDR4 RAM options.

3.3 USB Ports
Pi 3 Model B: 4 × USB 2.0 Ports.

Pi 4 Model B: 2 × USB 2.0 + 2 × USB 3.0 Ports.

For connecting keyboard, mouse, USB drives, WiFi dongles, etc.

3.4 Ethernet Port (RJ45)
Wired LAN (Local Area Network) connection.

Pi 3: 10/100 Mbps Ethernet.

Pi 4: Gigabit Ethernet.

3.5 Wireless Connectivity
Pi 3 onwards: Built-in Wi-Fi (802.11n) and Bluetooth 4.1/5.0.

Eliminates the need for external wireless dongles.

3.6 HDMI Ports
Full-size HDMI (Pi 3).

Micro-HDMI ports (2×) on Pi 4.

Used to connect to monitors, TVs, or projectors for display output.

3.7 Audio Output
3.5mm headphone jack.

Audio over HDMI is also supported.

3.8 CSI Camera Port
Camera Serial Interface (CSI) connector.

Allows connection of official Raspberry Pi Camera Modules.

Enables photography, video recording, and computer vision projects.

3.9 DSI Display Port
Display Serial Interface (DSI) connector.

Connect official Raspberry Pi touchscreen displays.

3.10 GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) Pins
40-pin header (standard on Model B from Pi 2 onward).

Pins can be:

Input (read sensors),

Output (control LEDs, relays),

Specialized (I2C, SPI, UART communication).

Core for building hardware projects.

Key GPIO Interfaces:
PWM – Pulse Width Modulation (motor control)

I2C – Communication with sensors

SPI – Fast serial devices

UART – Serial communication (e.g., GPS modules)

3.11 MicroSD Card Slot
No internal storage!

Operating system and files are stored on a microSD card (e.g., 16GB, 32GB).

Acts like a "hard drive" for the Pi.

3.12 Power Supply
Powered via a micro-USB (Pi 3) or USB-C connector (Pi 4).

Typical requirement:

Pi 3: 5V, 2.5A adapter.

Pi 4: 5V, 3A USB-C adapter.

Stable power is crucial, especially when connecting many peripherals.

3.13 Cooling (optional)
Pi 4 generates more heat → often uses heat sinks or small fans.

Good thermal management ensures stable performance.

4.  Connectivity Summary

Feature	Pi 3 Model B	Pi 4 Model B
WiFi	Yes (802.11n)	Yes (802.11ac)
Bluetooth	4.1	5.0
Ethernet	100 Mbps	Gigabit Ethernet
USB Ports	4 × USB 2.0	2 × USB 2.0 + 2 × USB 3.0
HDMI	1 × Full HDMI	2 × Micro-HDMI (4K support)
5.  Example Uses of Raspberry Pi Model B
IoT Projects: Home automation, weather monitoring.

Educational: Learning Linux, Python programming.

Media Center: Running Kodi, Plex.

DIY Servers: Web servers, VPN servers.

Robotics: Controlling robots via GPIO and cameras.

Edge AI: Computer vision, AI model deployment (especially with Pi 4).

6. Why Raspberry Pi is Popular?
Extremely low-cost compared to PCs.

Open hardware and massive community support.

Compact and portable.

Flexible for many applications (coding, electronics, multimedia).

Ecosystem: Cameras, displays, HATs (add-on boards) are widely available.
