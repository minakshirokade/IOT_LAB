 Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)
Overview:
Wi-Fi is a high-bandwidth, short-to-medium range wireless communication method.

Used when devices need internet access or high-speed LAN communication.

Power consumption is higher compared to protocols like Zigbee/LoRa.

Common Libraries:
ESP8266WiFi / WiFi.h (Arduino ecosystem)

For ESP8266 / ESP32 microcontrollers.

Easy connection to Wi-Fi networks and setting up HTTP, MQTT, etc.

WiFiManager

Auto-connect feature for IoT devices.

Simplifies provisioning devices without hard-coding SSIDs.

lwIP (Lightweight IP)

Low-level TCP/IP stack used on ESP32/ESP8266, very efficient.

Mongoose OS WiFi API

Higher-level embedded OS for IoT.

Supports Wi-Fi provisioning, OTA updates, MQTT over Wi-Fi.

Key Concepts:
AP mode (Access Point) vs STA mode (Station).

UDP for lightweight messages.

TCP for reliable communication (e.g., HTTP, MQTT).

ðŸ“¶ Bluetooth (Classic + BLE)
Overview:
Short-range (typically 10â€“100 meters).

Classic Bluetooth: Audio streaming (headsets, etc.)

BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy): Designed for IoT (low power, periodic data).

Common Libraries:
ArduinoBLE (for Arduino Nano 33 IoT, BLE boards)

Allows device to act as a BLE peripheral or central.

ESP32 BLE Arduino

For ESP32 chips.

Create GATT servers and clients easily.

bluepy (Python)

Bluetooth Low Energy communication for Linux (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

Bluesniff / BLE Scanner libraries

For scanning nearby BLE devices.

Key Concepts:
GATT Profile (Generic Attribute Profile)

Defines how to exchange structured data.

Advertising: BLE devices broadcast their existence.

Services and Characteristics:

Devices expose services, each service has characteristics (data points).

Security: Bonding, pairing, encryption.

 Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)
Overview:
Low-power, mesh-networking protocol.

Short-range but extremely scalable (hundreds of nodes).

Common in smart home (e.g., Philips Hue lights, smart plugs).

Common Libraries:
XBee Arduino Library (for Digi XBee modules)

Simplifies sending/receiving Zigbee data over serial.

Zigpy (Python)

Python Zigbee stack (used in Home Assistant projects).

ZStack (TI devices)

Texas Instruments' Zigbee stack for embedded development.

deCONZ API (for Conbee Zigbee gateway)

Provides REST API over Zigbee devices.

Key Concepts:
Coordinator: One device starts/manages the network.

Router: Extends network range, relays messages.

End Device: Battery-powered sensor, sleeps most of the time.

Cluster Library: Standardized device functions (on/off, temperature sensing).

 LoRa (Long Range)
Overview:
Ultra long range (up to 10 km rural / 3 km urban).

Very low power, suitable for remote sensing.

Works on unlicensed ISM bands (e.g., 868MHz Europe, 915MHz US).

LoRaWAN adds networking layers (gateways, network servers).

Common Libraries:
RadioHead Library (Arduino)

Basic radio packet transmission.

LoRa.h (Arduino LoRa library)

Easy packet-based communication for boards like Arduino MKR WAN 1300.

LMIC (LoraMAC-in-C)

Full LoRaWAN stack (MAC layer).

Supports OTAA/ABP joins, encryption, adaptive data rates.

Paho MQTT-SN (for LoRa over MQTT networks)

Key Concepts:
LoRa (PHY layer): Only transmits packets; simple modulation (Chirp Spread Spectrum).

LoRaWAN (MAC + network layer): Adds addressing, security, gateways.

Classes:

Class A (lowest power, default for sensors),

Class B (scheduled listening),

Class C (always listening).

OTAA (Over-the-Air Activation) vs ABP (Activation by Personalization) for network joining.
